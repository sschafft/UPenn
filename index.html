			<h3>Open Source Social Network</h3>
			<p>Discourse is a cutting-edge open source community collaboration tool. It was recently developed in Februrary 2013 by several of the developers from Stack Exchange, a major online community. It features live-updating, authentication from a variety of sources (Google, Facebook, Twitter), email integration, threaded discussions and automatic rating and point systems. It provides a simple interface and allows for converations to be moderated easily.</p>
      <p>It does not however provide support for events, projects or similar additional aspects that some communities might want. It simply focuses on maintaining and managing conversations. Given it is an open source tool it may be modified as needed and hosted in any manner that you may need (on-premise, on the cloud or some combination of the two).</p>

			<h3>Enterprise Social Network</h3>
			<p>SocialCast is a robust enterprise focused online community tool. It allows you to host the tool on the cloud and use the tool as the traditional "Software as a Service", but it also allows you to have your own copy hosted servers or on your own private Amazon Web Services server. This element of security can be very important for large organizations that may have privacy restrictions.</p>
      <p>The tool features a streamlined interface and allows for easy integration into other enterprise tools or internal websites so that conversations can take place in context across the organization. It also privdes analaytics around community engagement. It however does come with a cost per user once your community goes above 50 users. It is also a closed-source application which means that you cannot make any changes to the actual application and can only interact with the tool through its API.</p>

			<h3>Public Social Network</h3>
			<p>Google+ communities is a free tool that is offered by Google that allows users to create groups (both private and public) that allows for discussions around key topics of interest. The tool integrates easily with other google tools (Google calendar and Gmail specifically). It allows for event creation and tracking in addition to general conversations.</p>
      <p>Google communities however, doesnt allow you to make any changes to the code base and you cannot host Google+ communites on your own servers. It does not integrate with many enterprise tools and requires you to have a Google account to use.</p>
